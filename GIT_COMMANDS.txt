# Git Commands Guide for BHUVIS Dashboard Project

## PART 1: Pushing Changes to dashboard-apis Branch

# 1. Check current branch and status
git branch
git status

# 2. Create and switch to dashboard-apis branch (if it doesn't exist)
# If the branch already exists, just switch to it
git checkout dashboard-apis || git checkout -b dashboard-apis

# 3. Add only the changed files
git add BhuvisWebsite/client/src/pages/Dashboard/DashboardPage.js
git add BhuvisWebsite/client/src/pages/Dashboard/components/AirportDistanceWidget.js
git add BhuvisWebsite/client/src/pages/Dashboard/components/BusinessCategoryCard.js
git add BhuvisWebsite/DASHBOARD_CHANGES.md

# 4. Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Enhance dashboard with API integrations and UI improvements

- Added Airport Distance widget with API integration
- Fixed Business Category API integration
- Improved rent data handling with API
- Enhanced UI layout and responsiveness
- Added documentation of changes"

# 5. Push changes to the remote repository
# If this is a new branch:
git push -u origin dashboard-apis

# If the branch already exists:
git push

# 6. Verify the changes were pushed successfully
git log --oneline -5


## PART 2: Merging Branches - Standard Practices and Scenarios

### SCENARIO 1: Standard Merge (Fast-Forward)
# When your branch is ahead of the target branch with no conflicts

# 1. Ensure you have the latest version of both branches
git checkout main              # Switch to the target branch
git pull                       # Update the target branch
git checkout dashboard-apis    # Switch back to your feature branch
git pull                       # Update your feature branch

# 2. Merge main into your branch first (integration testing)
git merge main                 # Merge main into your branch
# Run tests to ensure everything works

# 3. Merge your branch into main
git checkout main
git merge dashboard-apis       # Fast-forward merge if possible

# 4. Push the changes
git push origin main


### SCENARIO 2: Merge with Conflicts

# 1. Attempt the merge
git checkout main
git merge dashboard-apis

# 2. If conflicts occur, you'll see a message. Resolve conflicts:
# a. Check which files have conflicts
git status

# b. Open each conflicted file and look for conflict markers (<<<<<<< HEAD, =======, >>>>>>>)
# c. Edit the files to resolve conflicts
# d. Add the resolved files
git add <resolved-file-paths>

# e. Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge dashboard-apis: resolve conflicts in [file names]"

# f. Push the changes
git push origin main


### SCENARIO 3: Creating a Pull Request (Recommended Industry Practice)

# 1. Push your feature branch
git push -u origin dashboard-apis

# 2. Go to GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket and create a Pull Request
# 3. Assign reviewers and add appropriate labels
# 4. After approval, merge through the web interface or:

# If you prefer command line merging after PR approval:
git checkout main
git pull                       # Get latest main including PR approvals
git merge dashboard-apis       # Should be clean if PR was approved
git push origin main


### SCENARIO 4: Squashing Commits for Clean History

# 1. If you have multiple small commits you want to combine before merging:
git checkout dashboard-apis
git rebase -i HEAD~<number-of-commits>
# An editor will open - change 'pick' to 'squash' or 's' for commits to combine
# Save and exit, then edit the commit message

# 2. Force push the squashed commits (only if the branch is not shared)
git push --force-with-lease origin dashboard-apis

# 3. Proceed with merge or PR


### SCENARIO 5: Aborting a Problematic Merge

# If you encounter issues during merge and want to start over:
git merge --abort

# If you've already committed the merge but haven't pushed:
git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD


## PART 3: Best Practices for Git Workflow

### 1. Always Pull Before Pushing or Merging
# Keep your branches updated with remote changes
git pull origin <branch-name>

### 2. Use Descriptive Branch Names
# Format: <type>/<description>
# Examples: feature/airport-distance, bugfix/api-integration, hotfix/dashboard-crash

### 3. Write Meaningful Commit Messages
# Format: <area>: <brief description> (50 chars or less)
# <longer description if needed> (72 chars per line)

### 4. Keep Commits Atomic
# Each commit should represent a single logical change

### 5. Regularly Rebase Feature Branches
git checkout dashboard-apis
git rebase main

### 6. Use Git Hooks for Quality Control
# Set up pre-commit hooks for linting, formatting, and tests

### 7. Never Rewrite Public History
# Don't force push to shared branches
# Don't rebase branches that others are working on

### 8. Delete Branches After Merging
git branch -d dashboard-apis          # Local branch
git push origin --delete dashboard-apis  # Remote branch
